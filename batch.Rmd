# Batch script
```{r}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE,
               fig.path='awesome_figs/',
               dpi=120,
               fig.width=8,
               fig.height=11
               )
```

## Some info
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

### plots!
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```

```{r super_cool_cars, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
data <- read.table(file = 'shell_output.txt', header = FALSE, sep = "")
```

```{r num_lines}
plot(data$V1)
```
